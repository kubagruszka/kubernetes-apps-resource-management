= Adjust resource quotas

By default, containers run with unbounded compute resources on a Kubernetes cluster. 
Developer Sandbox is managed OpenShift environment, its cluster resources are tailored per development needs.

== Discovering project resource limits

With resource quotas, cluster administrators can restrict resource consumption and creation on a namespace basis.
There will always be concerns that one Pod or Container could monopolize all available resources.
To avoid that, within a namespace, a Pod or Container can consume as much CPU and memory as defined by the `namespace's/project's` resource quota.

To discover the resource quota established for your namespace/project you can run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get resourcequota
----
At namespace/project level a LimitRange policy is employed to constrain resource allocations (to Pods or Containers).
You can find out the LimitRange established for a namespace by running `oc get limitrange` and ask for its description via:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc describe limitrange resource-limits
----

The output should be something similar to:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Name:       resource-limits
Namespace:  anasandbox-dev
Type        Resource  Min  Max  Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
----        --------  ---  ---  ---------------  -------------  -----------------------
Container   cpu       -    -    10m              1              -
Container   memory    -    -    64Mi             750Mi          -
----

The above LimitRange has enforced the default request/limit for compute resources in the namespace and automatically injects them to Containers at runtime.

== Adjusting container resources

By using a tool called https://github.com/rakyll/hey[hey], you can run a load test on your server and see how your system performs under different circumstances.

Let's run a hey command against the route exposed by previous deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export ROUTE_URL=$(kubectl get route greeting-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
hey -r 10 -c 4 -v $ROUTE_URL/messages
----

In the Developer Sandbox click on `Observe` and select the `Metric` tab. 
You can select CPU Usage or Memory Usage query to check the resources consumed by each of your pods:

[.mt-4.center]
image::cpu_usage.png[CPU Usage,600,600,align="center"]

[.mt-4.center]
image::memory_usage.png[Memory Usage,600,600,align="center"]

Based on that you can adjust your container resources in `application.properties`:

[.console-input]
[source,properties]
----
# Configuration file
# key = value

quarkus.openshift.resources.limits.cpu=200m
quarkus.openshift.resources.limits.memory=280Mi
quarkus.openshift.resources.requests.cpu=100m
quarkus.openshift.resources.requests.memory=140Mi
----

The resources in `target/kubernetes` folder will be reworked at compile time and contain these new definitions.

You can now deploy the changes by using the command:

[.console-input]
[source,properties]
----
mvn clean package -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true
----
