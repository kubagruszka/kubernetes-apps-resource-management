= Starter project

To demonstrate the concepts in this tutorial, we will use a simple Java application developed in Quarkus that exposes its own REST API and persists data in a PostgreSQL database, as well as doing a request to an external service to update content of the database.

In the following diagram you can see an overview of the application:

When the application is up and running, we call the `/messages/init` endpoint to populate the database content.

Now that we've introduced the application, let's deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.
